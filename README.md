# .NES ("dot" NES)

![dot NES logo](assets/Transparent/dotnes-ms.png)

.NET for the NES game console!

## Getting Started

Simply install the template:

```sh
dotnet new install dotnes.templates
```

Create a project:

```sh
dotnet new nes
```

Or use the project template in Visual Studio:

![Screenshot of the NES project template in Visual Studio](assets/vs-template.png)

Build and run it as you would a console app:

```sh
dotnet run
```

Of course, you can also just open the project in Visual Studio and hit F5.

> Note that Ctrl+F5 currently works better in C# Dev Kit in VS Code.

## Anatomy of an NES application

"Hello World" looks something like:

```csharp
// set palette colors
pal_col(0, 0x02);   // set screen to dark blue
pal_col(1, 0x14);   // fuchsia
pal_col(2, 0x20);   // grey
pal_col(3, 0x30);   // white

// write text to name table
vram_adr(NTADR_A(2, 2));            // set address
vram_write("Hello, world!");         // write bytes to video RAM

// enable PPU rendering (turn on screen)
ppu_on_all();

// infinite loop
while (true) ;
```

This looks very much like ["Hello World" in
C](https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.10.0/?platform=nes&file=hello.c), taking
advantage of the latest C# features in 2023.

By default the APIs like `pal_col`, etc. are provided by an implicit
`global using static NESLib;` and all code is written within a single
`Program.cs`.

Additionally, a `chr_generic.s` file is included as your game's "artwork" (lol?):

```assembly
.segment "CHARS"
.byte $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00
...
.byte $B4,$8C,$FC,$3C,$98,$C0,$00,$00
;;
```

This table of data is used to render sprites, text, etc.

## Scope

The types of things I wanted to get working initially:

* An object model for writing NES binaries
* Building a project should produce a `*.nes` binary, that is byte-for-byte
  identical to a program written in C.
* "Hello World" runs
* Byte arrays, and a more advanced sample like `attributetable` run
* Local variables work in some form
* Project template, MSBuild support, IDE support

Down the road, I might think about support for:

* Methods
* Structs
* Multiple files
* Some subset of useful BCL methods

## How it works

For lack of a better word, .NES is a "transpiler" that takes
[MSIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSIL) and transforms it directly into a
working [6502 microprocessor](http://www.6502.org/) binary that can run in your
favorite NES emulator. If you think about .NET's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler or
the various an Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilers, .NES is doing something similiar:
taking MSIL and turning it into runnable machine code.

To understand further, let's look at the MSIL of a `pal_col` method call:

```msil
// pal_col((byte)0, (byte)2);
IL_0000: ldc.i4.0
IL_0001: ldc.i4.2
IL_0002: call void [neslib]NES.NESLib::pal_col(uint8, uint8)
```

In 6502 assembly, this would look something like:

```assembly
A900          LDA #$00
20A285        JSR pusha
A902          LDA #$02
203E82        JSR _pal_col
```

You can see how one might envision using [System.Reflection.Metadata][srm] to
iterate over the contents of a .NET assembly and generate [6502
instructions][6502-instructions] -- that's how this whole idea was born!

Note that the method `NESLib.pal_col()` has no actual C# implementation. In
fact! there is *only* a reference assembly even shipped in .NES:

```powershell
> 7z l dotnes.0.1.1-alpha.nupkg
   Date      Time    Attr         Size   Compressed  Name
------------------- ----- ------------ ------------  ------------------------
2023-09-14 14:37:38 .....         8192         3169  ref\net8.0\neslib.dll
```

If you decompile `neslib.dll`, no code is inside:

```csharp
// Warning! This assembly is marked as a 'reference assembly', which means that it only contains metadata and no executable code.
// neslib, Version=0.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
// NES.NESLib
public static void pal_col(byte index, byte color) => throw null;
```

When generating `*.nes` binaries, .NES simply does a lookup for `pal_col` to
"jump" to the appropriate subroutine to call it.

.NES also emits the assembly instructions for the actual `pal_col` subroutine, a
code snippet of the implementation:

```csharp
/*
* 823E	8517          	STA TEMP                      ; _pal_col
* 8240	209285        	JSR popa                      
* 8243	291F          	AND #$1F                      
* 8245	AA            	TAX                           
* 8246	A517          	LDA TEMP                      
* 8248	9DC001        	STA $01C0,x                   
* 824B	E607          	INC PAL_UPDATE                
* 824D	60            	RTS
*/
Write(NESInstruction.STA_zpg, TEMP);
Write(NESInstruction.JSR, popa.GetAddressAfterMain(sizeOfMain));
Write(NESInstruction.AND, 0x1F);
Write(NESInstruction.TAX_impl);
Write(NESInstruction.LDA_zpg, TEMP);
Write(NESInstruction.STA_abs_X, PAL_BUF);
Write(NESInstruction.INC_zpg, PAL_UPDATE);
Write(NESInstruction.RTS_impl);
```

## Limitations

This is a hobby project, so only around 5 C# programs are known to work. But to
get an idea of what is not available:

* No runtime
* No BCL
* No objects or GC
* No debugger
* Strings are ASCII

What we *do* have is a way to express an NES program in a single `Program.cs`.

I needed a simple, small NES emulator to redistribute with .NES that runs on Mac
and Windows. Special thanks to [@daniel5151 and
ANESE](https://github.com/daniel5151/ANESE). This is the default NES emulator
used in the `dotnet.anese` package, [license
